Introduction to Unit Testing in C#:
Unit testing is the process of testing individual units or components of an application in isolation to ensure that they function as expected. In C#, unit tests are typically written using frameworks like NUnit, MSTest, or XUnit. Here, I'll provide a basic understanding of unit testing using NUnit as an example.

Key Concepts:
Test Framework: NUnit, MSTest, or XUnit provide the infrastructure for writing and running tests.
Assertions: Assertions are used to verify that the expected output matches the actual output of a unit.
Test Suites: A collection of related test cases.
Test Runner: A tool or part of the framework that executes the tests and provides feedback on whether they passed or failed.
